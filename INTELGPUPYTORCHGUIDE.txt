If you are running Linux Mint, make sure that you do the following in order to make it work.

Ensure that your gpu is getting detected by clinfo. If it's not follow the following very crucial steps


sudo apt-get install beignet-opencl-icd ocl-icd-libopencl1 clinfo



Then, you go ahead and make a new python env. Inside of that environment you run:

pip install torch==2.7.1+xpu torchvision==0.22.1+xpu torchaudio==2.7.1+xpu intel-cmplr-lib-rt intel-cmplr-lib-ur intel-cmplr-lic-rt intel-sycl-rt pytorch-triton-xpu tcmlib umf intel-pti --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple


this works but isnt necessary anymore
